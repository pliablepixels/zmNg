# GitHub Actions Build Workflows

This directory contains automated build workflows for zmNg across multiple platforms.

## ⚠️ Quick Fix: macOS "Damaged App" Error

If you downloaded a macOS build and get a "damaged" error, that is not because the app is damaged. It is because MacOS blocks you.
In more recent versions this has become painful. I couldn't get `xcattr` variants to work. Anyway, simple answer: use [sentinel](https://github.com/alienator88/Sentinel)

## Available Workflows

### Individual Platform Builds

Each platform has its own dedicated workflow that can be triggered manually or on git tags:

- **`build-android.yml`** - Builds Android APK and AAB
- **`build-macos.yml`** - Builds macOS DMG installer
- **`build-linux.yml`** - Builds Linux AppImage and DEB packages
- **`build-windows.yml`** - Builds Windows MSI and NSIS installers

### Combined Build Workflow

- **`build-all.yml`** - Build multiple platforms in parallel (configurable)

## How to Trigger Builds

### Recommended: Using the Release Script

The easiest way to create a release is using the automated release script:

```bash
# From the project root
./scripts/release.sh
```

This script will:
1. Verify all changes are committed and pushed
2. Read the version from `app/package.json`
3. Create a git tag in the format `zmNg-{version}`
4. Push the tag to trigger all build workflows
5. Create a GitHub Release with build artifacts

**Safety Checks**: The script performs validation before creating a release:
- Fails if there are uncommitted changes
- Fails if there are unpushed commits
- Asks for confirmation before proceeding

**Handling Existing Tags**: If a tag already exists, the script will ask if you want to move it to the current commit. This is useful when you need to rebuild a release with fixes.

### Manual Trigger (Workflow Dispatch)

1. Go to **Actions** tab in GitHub
2. Select the workflow you want to run
3. Click **Run workflow**
4. Enter the version number (e.g., `1.0.0`)
5. For `build-all.yml`, optionally specify platforms (default: all)

### Manual Tag Push (Alternative)

You can also manually push a tag to trigger builds:

```bash
# Tag format must be: zmNg-{version}
git tag zmNg-1.0.0
git push origin zmNg-1.0.0
```

To move an existing tag to a new commit:

```bash
# Delete old tag
git tag -d zmNg-1.0.0
git push origin --delete zmNg-1.0.0

# Create new tag and push
git tag zmNg-1.0.0
git push origin zmNg-1.0.0 --force
```

This will:
- Trigger all individual platform workflows
- Create a GitHub Release with build artifacts attached

## Build Artifacts

After a successful build, artifacts are available for download:

### Android
- `app-release.apk` - APK for sideloading
- `app-release.aab` - App Bundle for Google Play Store

### macOS
- `zmNg.dmg` - DMG installer
- `zmNg.app` - Application bundle

### Linux
- `zmNg.AppImage` - Universal AppImage
- `zmNg.deb` - Debian package

### Windows
- `zmNg.msi` - MSI installer
- `zmNg.exe` - NSIS installer (if configured)

## Build Requirements

### Required: GitHub Actions Permissions

For automated releases to work, you must enable write permissions:

1. Go to repository **Settings** → **Actions** → **General**
2. Scroll to **Workflow permissions**
3. Select **"Read and write permissions"**
4. Click **Save**

Without this, you'll get 403 errors when trying to create releases.

### Android
- No additional secrets required
- Builds unsigned APK and AAB by default
- For signed releases, configure signing in `app/android/app/build.gradle`

### Desktop Platforms (macOS, Linux, Windows)
- Uses Tauri for desktop builds
- **All builds are unsigned by default** (no secrets required)
- Linux builds work without issues
- macOS/Windows builds will require users to bypass security warnings (see below)
- **Optional macOS Code Signing** (to avoid "damaged" error):
  - `APPLE_CERTIFICATE` - Base64-encoded .p12 certificate
  - `APPLE_CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD` - Certificate password
  - `APPLE_SIGNING_IDENTITY` - Developer ID (e.g., "Developer ID Application: Your Name (TEAM_ID)")
  - `APPLE_ID` - Apple ID email
  - `APPLE_PASSWORD` - App-specific password
  - `APPLE_TEAM_ID` - Team ID from Apple Developer account
- **Optional Tauri updater signing**:
  - `TAURI_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY`
  - `TAURI_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY_PASSWORD`

## Firebase Configuration

**Important**: Ensure `google-services.json` (Android) and `GoogleService-Info.plist` (iOS) are properly configured in your repository for push notifications to work.

See `ANDROID_BUILD.md` for Firebase setup instructions.

## Customization

### Changing Build Settings

- **Android**: Edit `app/android/app/build.gradle`
- **Desktop**: Edit `app/src-tauri/tauri.conf.json`

### Adding Code Signing

For production releases, you should configure code signing:

**Android**: Add signing configuration to gradle
**macOS**: Set up Apple Developer certificates
**Windows**: Configure code signing certificate

See Tauri documentation for details: https://tauri.app/v1/guides/distribution/sign-your-application

## macOS "Damaged" App Error

If you get a **"zmNg.app is damaged and can't be opened. You should move it to the Trash"** error, this is because the app is not signed/notarized. You have two options:


### Option 1: Bypass Security
Use [Sentinel](https://github.com/alienator88/Sentinel)

### Option 2: Set Up Code Signing (Recommended for Distribution)

To produce properly signed and notarized builds:

1. **Get Apple Developer Account** ($99/year)

2. **Create Developer ID Certificate**:
   - Go to Apple Developer Portal → Certificates
   - Create "Developer ID Application" certificate
   - Download and install in Keychain

3. **Export Certificate**:
   ```bash
   # Export from Keychain as .p12
   # Then convert to base64
   base64 -i certificate.p12 | pbcopy
   ```

4. **Create App-Specific Password**:
   - Go to appleid.apple.com
   - Sign In → Security → App-Specific Passwords
   - Generate password for "GitHub Actions"

5. **Add GitHub Secrets**:
   - Go to repository Settings → Secrets → Actions
   - Add the following secrets:
     - `APPLE_CERTIFICATE`: Paste base64 certificate
     - `APPLE_CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD`: Certificate password
     - `APPLE_SIGNING_IDENTITY`: "Developer ID Application: Your Name (TEAM_ID)"
     - `APPLE_ID`: Your Apple ID email
     - `APPLE_PASSWORD`: App-specific password
     - `APPLE_TEAM_ID`: Team ID from developer portal

6. **Re-run Workflow** - The app will now be signed and notarized

## Troubleshooting

### Build Fails

Check the Actions tab for detailed error logs. Common issues:

- **Missing dependencies**: Check Node.js/Rust versions
- **Build errors**: Ensure local builds work first
- **Artifact upload fails**: Check file paths match your build output

### Android Build Issues

- Ensure `google-services.json` exists at `app/android/app/google-services.json`
- Verify Java 17 is being used
- Check Gradle version compatibility

### Desktop Build Issues

- Ensure Rust toolchain is properly installed
- Check Tauri configuration in `tauri.conf.json`
- Verify all platform-specific dependencies are installed

## Local Testing

Before pushing, test builds locally:

```bash
# Android
cd app
npm run android:release

# Desktop (macOS/Linux/Windows)
cd app
npm run tauri:build
```
