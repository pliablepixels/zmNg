# Monitors

The Monitors screen shows all cameras configured on your ZoneMinder server. Each monitor is displayed as a card with a live snapshot and status information.

## Monitor Cards

Each card shows:

- **Live snapshot** - A periodically refreshed image from the camera
- **Monitor name** - The name configured in ZoneMinder
- **Function** - The current monitoring mode (Monitor, Modect, Record, etc.)
- **Status** - Whether the monitor is online, in alarm, or offline
- **Event count** - Number of recent events

Tap a card to open the [Monitor Detail](#monitor-detail) view.

## Filtering Monitors

Use the filter controls at the top of the screen to narrow down which monitors are shown:

- **Groups**: Filter by ZoneMinder monitor groups
- **Status**: Show only monitors in a specific state
- **Search**: Type to filter by monitor name

Filters persist across navigation within the same session.

## Monitor Detail

### Live View

- **go2rtc streaming** - Real-time streaming via go2rtc if configured on your server

### PTZ Controls

If the monitor has PTZ (Pan-Tilt-Zoom) configured in ZoneMinder, directional controls appear below the live view. Use these to pan, tilt, and zoom the camera.
