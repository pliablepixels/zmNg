# Profiles

Profiles store connection details for your ZoneMinder servers. You can create multiple profiles to switch between different servers or accounts.

## Adding a Profile

1. Open zmNg - if no profile exists, you'll be taken to the Profiles screen automatically
2. Tap **Add Profile**
3. Fill in the connection details:

| Field | Description | Example |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| **Name** | A label for this profile | "Home Cameras" |
| **Portal URL** | Your ZoneMinder server URL | `https://zm.example.com/zm` |
| **Username** | ZoneMinder login username | `admin` |
| **Password** | ZoneMinder login password | |

4. Tap **Test Connection** to verify the credentials and API access
5. Tap **Save**

:::{tip}
The Portal URL should point to the base ZoneMinder web path, typically ending in `/zm`. zmNg will auto-discover the API endpoint from there.

## QR Code Import

You can import a profile by scanning a QR code generated by another zmNg instance. This is useful for setting up the app on a new device without re-typing credentials.

1. On the source device, go to the profile and select **Share as QR Code**
2. On the new device, tap **Scan QR Code** on the Profiles screen
3. Point the camera at the QR code

The profile data (including password) is transferred via the QR code. No data is sent over the network during this process.

## Switching Profiles

If you have multiple profiles, tap on a profile card to switch to it. The app will reconnect to the selected server.

## Editing a Profile

Tap the edit icon on a profile card to modify the connection details. You can change the URL, credentials, or display name.

## Deleting a Profile

Tap the delete icon on a profile card. You'll be asked to confirm before the profile is removed.

## Security

Passwords are encrypted at rest:

- **Web/Desktop**: AES-256-GCM encryption with PBKDF2 key derivation (100,000 iterations)
- **Android**: Hardware-backed encryption via Android Keystore
- **iOS**: Keychain storage

Passwords are never stored in plaintext.

## Troubleshooting

**"Connection failed"**
- Verify the Portal URL is correct and accessible from your device
- Check that ZoneMinder API is enabled (`OPT_USE_API = 1` in ZoneMinder options)
- Self-signed certificates are not supported - use a valid certificate or plain HTTP

**"Authentication failed"**
- Verify username and password
- Check that the user has API access permissions in ZoneMinder
