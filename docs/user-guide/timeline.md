# Timeline & Heatmap

The Timeline view provides a visual representation of events over time, helping you spot patterns and quickly navigate to specific time periods.

## Timeline

The timeline displays events as colored bars along a horizontal time axis. Each monitor gets its own row, so you can see when events occurred across all cameras.

- **Zoom** in and out to view different time spans (hours, days, weeks)
- **Pan** left and right to move through time
- **Tap an event bar** to jump to that event's detail view

## Heatmap

The heatmap shows event density over time as a colored grid. Darker colors indicate more events during that time period. This helps you identify:

- **Busy hours** - Times when the most events occur
- **Quiet periods** - Times with little to no activity
- **Patterns** - Recurring activity at specific times or days

## Refresh

Timeline and heatmap data refreshes automatically:

- **Normal bandwidth**: Every 60 seconds
- **Low bandwidth**: Every 120 seconds

You can also pull to refresh manually on mobile.
